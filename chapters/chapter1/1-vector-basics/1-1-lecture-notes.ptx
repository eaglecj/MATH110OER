		Vectors and basic operations
	</title>
	
	<introduction>
		In this section we introduce <em>vectors</em>, which are the fundamental objects of study in linear algebra.  We begin in the plane, <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, where we can easily interpret vectors both algebraically and geometrically.  We then move on to the general setting of <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.  This section also introduces the two most important operations on vectors: Addition and scalar multiplication.
