		Vectors and basic operations
	</title>
	
	<introduction>
		In this section we introduce <em>vectors</em>, which are the fundamental objects of study in linear algebra.  We begin in the plane, <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>, where we can easily interpret vectors both algebraically and geometrically.  We then move on to the general setting of <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.  This section also introduces the two most important operations on vectors: Addition and scalar multiplication.

		<title>
			Vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.
		</title>
		
		<definition>
			A <em>vector</em> in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is a column with two entries, each of which is a real number.  <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is the collection of all such vectors.
		</definition>
		<example>
			Here are some examples of vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>: <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}\pi \\ -2\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}</m>.
		</example>
		<p>
			Just like in the ordered pair notation for points, the order of the numbers matters.  Thus <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\0\end{bmatrix}</m> is <em>not</em> the same vector as <m>\begin{bmatrix}0\\1\end{bmatrix}</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Geometrically, vectors arise as <em>directed line segments</em> describing how to get from one point in the plane to another.  If <m>P = (x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>Q = (x_2, y_2)</m> are points in the plane then the vector <m>\vec{PQ}</m> is the vector <m>\vec{PQ} = \begin{bmatrix}x_2-x_1 \\ y_2-y_1\end{bmatrix}</m>.
		</p>
		<example>
			Let <m>P = (2, 3)</m> and <m>Q = (-1, 1)</m>.  Then <m>\vec{PQ} = \begin{bmatrix}-1-2 \\ 1-3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}-3\\-2\end{bmatrix}</m>.  Geometrically, we have the following picture:

						\begin{tikzpicture}
					
						\end{tikzpicture}
					</latex-image>
				</image>-->
			</figure>
		</example>

		<p>
			The next example shows that our algebraic representation of vectors does not determine the starting point or ending point of the geometric representation.
		</p>
		<example>
			Let <m>O = (0, 0), P = (1, 2), Q = (3, 3), R = (4, 5)</m>.  Then <m>\vec{OP} = \begin{bmatrix}1-0\\2-0\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}</m>, and <m>\vec{QR} = \begin{bmatrix}4-3\\5-3\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\end{bmatrix}</m>.
				<figure>
				<caption>The vectors <m>\vec{OP}</m> and <m>\vec{QR}</m>.</caption>
				<!--<image>
					<latex-image>
						\begin{tikzpicture}
					
						\end{tikzpicture}
					</latex-image>
				</image>-->
			</figure>
		</example>
		<p>
			The geometric interpretation of two vectors being equal is that they have the same length and point in the same direction (we will define "length" and "direction" carefully in the next section).  This means that we can move a vector around without changing which vector it is, as long as we do not change the length or direction.  It is helpful to think of vectors as "instructions": Knowing a list of instructions does not tell you where you will end up, only how that place relates to where you started.

		<definition>
			Suppose that <m>\vec{v}</m> is a vector in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m>.  We say that <m>\vec{v}</m> is drawn in <em>standard position</em> if it is drawn in the plane so that the starting point of the vector is the origin, <m>(0, 0)</m>.

			Addition and scalar multiplication
		</title>
		<definition>
			Suppose that <m>\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1\\y_1\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}x_2\\y_2\end{bmatrix}</m>.  We define <em>vector addition</em> by defining <m>\vec{v}+\vec{w} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1+x_2\\y_1+y_2\end{bmatrix}</m>.
