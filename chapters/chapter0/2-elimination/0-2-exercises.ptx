							We will see in <xref ref="chapt-1" /> that a single linear equation in three variables represents a plane in three-dimensional space.  Do the three planes, <m>x+y-3z=2</m>, <m>2x+y+z=1</m>, and <m>3x + 2y-2z =0</m> have a common point of intersection? If so, find one and if not, tell why there is no such point.  Note that a point of intersection is a point that satisfies all three equations.
						</statement>
						<hint>
							The three planes give a system of three equations.  A solution to the system will be the common point of intersection. 
						</hint>
						<hint>
							To solve the system of three equations, transform the system into one that exhibits the triangular structure of <xref ref = "exercise-back-substitution"/>. 
						</hint>
						
						<answer>
						The three planes do not have a common point of intersection because the system of equations is <em> inconsistent </em>, it has no solution.
						</answer>
						<solution>
							We start with the system of three equations. 
								<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp = \amp 2
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 2x + y +z \amp = \amp 1
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											3x  + 2y -2z \amp = \amp 0
										</mrow>
									</md>
							To transform this system into one that exhibits a triangular structure we must first eliminate the variable <m> x </m> from the third equation.  We may do to this by subtracting (3) times the first row from the third row.  
								<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp =  2 \amp \hspace{.2in}
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 2x + y +z \amp = 1 \amp
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 -y +7z \amp = -6 \amp R_3-3R1  
										</mrow>
									</md>
							Next, we can eliminate the variable <m> x </m> from the second equation.  We may do this by subtracting (2) times the first row from the second row. 

									<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp =  2 \amp \hspace{.2in}
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											  -y +7z \amp = -3 \amp  R_2-2R_1
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 -y +7z \amp = -6 \amp
										</mrow>
									</md>

							Lastly, notice that subtracting the last two equations gives a contradiction, 0 is certainly not equal to -3.  
							
								<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp =  2 \amp \hspace{.2in}
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											  -y +7z \amp = -3 \amp 
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 0\amp = -3 \amp  R_3 - R_2
										</mrow>
									</md>	

									Therefore, the system does not have a solution and so the three planes do not have a common point of intersection.

						<solution>
							Each of the points,<m>(-1,6)</m>, <m>(2,0)</m>, and <m>(3,2)</m>, is a solution to the quadratic equation <m>y = a + bx + cx^2</m>, which means that each of those values of <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> satisfies the equation.  This creates a system of three equations with three variables <m> a,b </m> and <m> c </m>.

							Rewriting this system as an augmented matrix,

								\matr{ccc|c}{1\amp -1\amp 1\amp 6\\ 1 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 0 \\ 1 \amp 3 \amp 9 \amp 2}
							</me>
							At this point, we may perform row operations to transform this augmented matrix into a triangular form.  Our first task is to eliminate the lower left term.  We may do this by subtracting row 2 from row 1.

							Next, we may eleminate the left most entry of the middle row by subtracting row 1 from row 2.

								\matr{ccc|c}{1\amp -1\amp 1\amp 6\\ 0 \amp 3 \amp 3 \amp -6 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 5 \amp 2} \amp \hspace{.25in} R_2 - R_1 \to R_2
							</mrow>
							</md>
							Next, we simplify the second row by multiplying by <m> \frac{1}{3} .</m>  This step is not necessary for getting the matrix to triangular form, it just makes things simpler.

								\matr{ccc|c}{1\amp -1\amp 1\amp 6\\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 1 \amp -2 \\ 0 \amp 1 \amp 5 \amp 2} \amp \hspace{.25in} \frac{1}{3}R_2 \to R_2
							</mrow>
							</md>
							Our last step to write this augmented matrix in triangular form is to eliminate the middle term of the last row.  We may do this by subtracting row 2 from row 3.

							</md>
							Now, we can solve the system by back substitution. 
							<md>
										<mrow> 
											a -b +c \amp = 6
										</mrow>
										<mrow>
											 b + c \amp = -2
										</mrow>
										<mrow>
											 4c \amp = 4
										</mrow>
									</md>  
							Substitution <m> c =1 </m> into the second equation gives <m> b = -3. </m> Finally, substituting both <m> b </m> and <m> c </m> into the first equation and solving for <m> a, </m> yields the final solution <m> a = 2, b = -3, c = 1 </m>.  Just for fun, we may graph the parabola <m> y = 2 -3 x + x^2 </m> to verify that it indeed does contain the points given.
