		Linear independence
	</title>
	<p> To motivate the material of this section we begin by revisiting <xref ref="ex-find-all-vectors-in-span" />.  In that example we showed that <m>\span\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}\right) = \mathbb{R}^2</m>, but our calculations actually showed us more.  For later convenience, let <m>S = \span\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}\right)</m>.</p>
	<p>In trying to determine whether or not a vector <m>\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}</m> is in <m>S</m> we are looking for scalars <m>r, s, t</m> such that <me>\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix} = r\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}+s\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}+t\begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}</me>.</p>
	<p>After row reduction we ended up with the following system of equations:</p>
	<md>
		<mrow> r+\frac{1}{2}t = \frac{x+y}{2} </mrow>
		<mrow> s+\frac{5}{2}t = \frac{x-y}{2} </mrow>
	</md>
	<p> We see that <m>t</m> is a free variable, so (no matter what <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are) we can choose <m>t</m> arbitrarily and still get a solution to our system.  In particular, we can always choose <m>t=0</m>, and get the solution <m>r = \frac{x+y}{2}, s = \frac{x-y}{2}</m>.  Looking back at where the variables <m>r, s, t</m> appeared, choosing <m>t=0</m> amounts to not using the vector <m>\begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}</m> in our linear combination.  That is, we have shown that in this example any linear combination of <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}</m>, <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}</m>, and <m>\begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}</m> can actually be written as a linear combination of just <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}</m> and <m>\begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}</m>.  In other words, <me>\span\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}\right) = \span\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}\right)</me>.</p>
	<p> In this example the vector <m>\begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}</m> was redundant, in that removing it did not change the vectors we could get as linear combinations.  The collection <m>S</m> can be described as either <m>\span\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}\right)</m> or as <m>\span\left(\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}1\\-1\end{bmatrix}\right)</m>, but the latter description is more parsimonious.  Moreover, we cannot remove any more vectors from our list and still have the span be <m>S</m>, because the span of a single vector in <m>\mathbb{R}^2</m> is a line, while we already know that <m>S = \mathbb{R}^2</m>.  We therefore have found a collection of vectors with no redundancies whose span is <m>S</m>.</p>
	<p>The remainder of this section is all about making the idea of "a set of vectors with no redundancies" precise.</p>
	<definition>
		<p>Let <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> be vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.  We say that <m>\vec{v_1},\ldots,\vec{v_k}</m> are <em>linearly independent</em> if the only way to write <m>a_1\vec{v_1} + \cdots + a_k\vec{v_k} = \vec{0}</m> is by using <m>a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_k = 0</m>.  If <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> are not linearly independent then they are called <em>linearly dependent</em>.</p>
	</definition>
	<note>
		<p> Given any vectors <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> if we let <m>a_1 = a_2 = \cdots = a_k = 0</m> then we certainly do get <m>a_1\vec{v_1}+\cdots+a_k\vec{v_k} = \vec{0}</m>.  We sometimes say that the expression <m>0\vec{v_1} + \cdots + 0\vec{v_k}</m> is the <em>trivial</em> way of obtaining <m>\vec{0}</m> as a linear combination of <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m>.  Saying that <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> are linearly independent is saying that there is no <em>non-trivial</em> choice of scalars that will allow us to make a linear combination of <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> be <m>\vec{0}</m>.</p>

	<p> The first part of the solution to the previous example occurs frequently enough to be worth recording as a theorem. </p>
	<theorem xml:id="thm-indep-iff-unique-solution">
		<statement>
			<p> Let <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> be vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>, and let <m>A</m> be the matrix whose columns are <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m>.  The vectors <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> are linearly independent if and only if the linear system represented by <m>[A|\vec{0}]</m> has a unique solution.</p>
		</statement>
		<proof>
		</proof>
	</theorem>
	<example>
		<p> Any set of vectors containing <m>\vec{0}</m> will be linearly dependent.  Indeed, if we have the vectors <m>\vec{0}, \vec{v_2}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> then we can write <m>5\vec{0} + 0\vec{v_2} + \cdots + 0\vec{v_k} = \vec{0}</m>, and not all of the coefficients on the left side are <m>0</m>.</p>
	</example>

	</example>
	<p> In the example we saw a set of linearly dependent vectors, and we also noticed that one of those vectors could be expressed as a linear combination of the others.  In fact, this always happens, which is why our definition of linear independence is a good notion of having no redundancies. </p>
	<theorem xml:id="thm-linear-dependent-redundant">
		<statement>
			<p> Suppose that <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> are vectors in <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m>.  The vectors <m>\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_k}</m> are linearly dependent if and only if there is some <m>i</m>, <m>1 \leq i \leq k</m>, such that <m>\vec{v_i}</m> is in <m>\span(\vec{v_1}, \ldots, \vec{v_{i-1}}, \vec{v_{i+1}}, \ldots, \vec{v_k})</m>. </p>

	<note>
		<p> Caution!  <xref ref="thm-linear-dependent-redundant" /> says that if you have a linearly dependent set of vectors then there is <em>at least one</em> vector that is in the span of the others, but it does <em>not</em> say that <em>every</em> vector is in the span of the others.  Using <xref ref="thm-span-unchanged-removal" />, this means that if you have a linearly dependent set then there is at least one vector that you can remove without changing the span, but there may also be vectors whose removal does change their span.</p>
