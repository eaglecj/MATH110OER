						<hint>
							To solve the system of three equations, transform the system into one that exhibits the triangular structure of <xref ref = "exercise-back-substitution"/>. 
						</hint>
						
						<answer>
						The three planes do not have a common point of intersection because the system of equations is <em> inconsistent </em>, it has no solution.
						</answer>
						<solution>
							We start with the system of three equations. 
								<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp = \amp 2
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 2x + y +z \amp = \amp 1
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											3x  + 2y -2z \amp = \amp 0
										</mrow>
									</md>
							To transform this system into one that exhibits a triangular structure we must first eliminate the variable <m> x </m> from the third equation.  We may do to this by subtracting (3) times the first row from the third row.  
								<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp =  2 \amp \hspace{.2in}
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 2x + y +z \amp = 1 \amp
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 -y +7z \amp = -6 \amp R_3-3R1  
										</mrow>
									</md>
							Next, we can eliminate the variable <m> x </m> from the second equation.  We may do this by subtracting (2) times the first row from the second row. 

									<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp =  2 \amp \hspace{.2in}
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											  -y +7z \amp = -3 \amp  R_2-2R_1
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 -y +7z \amp = -6 \amp
										</mrow>
									</md>

							Lastly, notice that subtracting the last two equations gives a contradiction, 0 is certainly not equal to -3.  
							
								<md>
										<mrow>
											x + y -3z \amp =  2 \amp \hspace{.2in}
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											  -y +7z \amp = -3 \amp 
										</mrow>
										<mrow>											 
											 0\amp = -3 \amp  R_3 - R_2
										</mrow>
									</md>	

									Therefore, the system does not have a solution and so the three planes do not have a common point of intersection.

							We may back substitute in order to solve the system.  We have that <m> y =13 </m> from the second equation.  Substituing <m> y =13</m>  into the first equation gives <m> 3x + 4(13) =1 .</m>   Solving this equation for <m> x </m> yields <m> x = -17 </m>.   Therefore, the solution to the system is <m> x = -17 , y = 13 </m>.

							Each of the points,<m>(-1,6)</m>, <m>(2,0)</m>, and <m>(3,2)</m>, is a solution to the quadratic equation <m>y = a + bx + cx^2</m>, which means that each of those values of <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> satisfies the equation.  This creates a system of three equations with three variables <m> a,b </m> and <m> c </m>.

							Rewriting this system as an augmented matrix,

								\matr{ccc|c}{1\amp -1\amp 1\amp 6\\ 1 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 0 \\ 1 \amp 3 \amp 9 \amp 2}
							</me>
							At this point, we may perform row operations to transform this augmented matrix into a triangular form.  Our first task is to eliminate the lower left term.  We may do this by subtracting row 2 from row 1.

							Next, we may eleminate the left most entry of the middle row by subtracting row 1 from row 2.

							Next, we simplify the second row by multiplying by <m> \frac{1}{3} .</m>  This step is not necessary for getting the matrix to triangular form, it just makes things simpler.

							Our last step to write this augmented matrix in triangular form is to eliminate the middle term of the last row.  We may do this by subtracting row 2 from row 3.

							Substitution <m> c =1 </m> into the second equation gives <m> b = -3. </m> Finally, substituting both <m> b </m> and <m> c </m> into the first equation and solving for <m> a, </m> yields the final solution <m> a = 2, b = -3, c = 1 </m>.  Just for fun, we may graph the parabola <m> y = 2 -3 x + x^2 </m> to verify that it indeed does contain the points given.
