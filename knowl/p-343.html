<p>Our next goal is to describe the general form and normal form equations for a line.  This turns out to be more complicated in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) than it is in \(\mathbb{R}^2\text{,}\) because in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) there are infinitely many different directions that are orthogonal to any fixed line.  At any particular point the vectors that are orthogonal to a line form a plane, so to give a normal form equation for the line we will need to give enough normal vectors to describe this plane.  Intuitively, you might expect that planes are ``two-dimensional", and hence that two (non-parallel) vectors should be sufficient.  This is true (but it will be some time before we are ready to make it precise).</p>
