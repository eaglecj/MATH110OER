<li>By exchanging row \(2\) and \(3\text{,}\) we arrive at a matrix in row-echelon form with two leading \(1\)s. Thus, the rank of the matrix is \(2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>By dividing the first row by \(2\text{,}\) we arrive at a matrix in row-echelon form with one leading  \(1\text{.}\) Thus, the rank of the matrix is \(1\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Since the matrix is in REF, we just need to count the leading \(1\)s: the rank of the matrix is \(2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Since the matrix is in REF, we just need to count the leading \(1\)s: the rank of the matrix is \(3\text{.}\)</li>
<li>Since the matrix is in REF, we just need to count the leading \(1\)s: the rank of the matrix is \(2\text{.}\)</li>
<li>To bring the matrix in REF, we substract the first row from the second and from the third row. The resulting matrix is<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix} 0 \amp  0 \amp  1 \\  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \\  0 \amp  0 \amp  0 \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation*}
</div>which has one leading \(1\) and hence rank \(1\text{.}\)</li>
