<p>In <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-solving-system-using-row-operations.html" title="Example 1.2.7">ExampleÂ 1.2.7</a> we used a sequence of row operations to transform the augmented matrix of a linear system into the augmented matrix of a much simpler linear system.  We could have used the three elementary row operations in any order, and stopped at any time, and we still would have had a system equivalent to our original one.  In this section we answer two questions: How can we recognize when we have reached the simplest possible form of a system, and what sequence of row operations will get us there?  We start with the question of how to tell when we should stop doing row operations.</p>
